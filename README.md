# Advent of Code 2019

### Level 1

Who cares? I thought that this will not endup on github

### Level 2

Yeah, good old state machine, it was good.
And from this point on, solutions will only containt
the part 2 of the challenge, for lazy reasons.

### Level 3

I should have used vectors instead of points, but whatever.
I copied code from stackoverflow for the intersection part.
I learned all that back in university in the linear algebra
course, but yeah, I don't remember all details from the top
of my head. Also it's impressive how I didn't even look for
a geometry library.

### Level 4

This was so simple to implement, the hard was to understand
what the author really wanted with those doubles.

### Level 5

Ah, yeah once again, the machine state, well, I didn't care
so that ðŸ’© ended up unmantaniable. sweep it under the rug,
Hopefully I won't see it again!

### Level 6

This one was easy, just graph operations.

### Level 7

DAMN IT!!! Why the author, likes so much this kind of problems.
One last push, this time maybe we won't see it again.

Actually the part of using coroutines was really clever,
unfortunatelly the implementation is crap.

### Level 8

Ok, this was actually easy. Too late but I start noticing a pattern.
1 easy problem followed by 1 hard problem.

### Level 9

As expected, once again a relatively hard problem + using the state
machine. It wasn't hard per se, but since the code wasn't written
to be maintainable. Maybe I should refactor this.

### Level 10

I spend a good chunk of time trying to understand the problem, 
it wasn't easy at first, specially if you can't see the data.
Once I started, building the pygame viewer everything makes
sense. On the other hand I spend way to much time a simple
error, (hardcoding the best spot) :facepalm:

### Level 11

I didn't like it, it doesn't provide an example intcode input.
Also for some reason I had to do some hack to get the 
right answer in part 2, maybe I have a bug in my state machine,
or maybe I did something wrong when printing the map.
To be fair it was easy, because we have generators in python,
so, tonight I can sleep like a baby.

### Retrospective

Guessing what to actually implement takes more time than solving the problem itself.
Not that different than project in real life.
